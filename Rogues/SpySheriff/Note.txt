When working with all malware (old or new), exercise caution before running any potentially malicious code. This repository is not intended for any malicious use, but simply to act as an educational reference for malware researchers, educators, InfoSec students, and anyone interested in historical code.

SpySheriff is malware that disguises itself as anti-spyware software. It attempts to mislead the user with false security alerts, threatening them into buying the program. Like other rogue antiviruses, after producing a list of false threats, it prompts the user to pay to remove them. The software is particularly difficult to remove, since it nests its components in System Restore folders, and also blocks some system management tools. However, SpySheriff can be removed by an experienced user, antivirus software, or by using a rescue disk.

WARNING: DON'T Run this on your real system or else you'll get badly infected! It's only recommended to test this Rogue/Trojan/Malware using a Virtual Machine or Sandbox, Which can be safe, But NEVER do so when you have a network adapter on, Or else The Malware you're about to run might spread to others or even infect the network to spread copies, etc.
