A RAT is a type of malware that allows hackers to gain unauthorized access to other computers. They can be used for establishing a remote connection to the infected device, such as scammer's PCs, to take malicious control to the victim's computer. They can also be used to mine cryptocurrencies with the use of a malicious mining program, infecting the target machine with several malware, using a shell to execute commands when the target device is connected, fetching keyboard presses via a keylogger, or building a malicious program via a builder including in the RAT.
