A ransomware is a type of destructive malware that encrypts users files unless a ransom is paid. Some file-encrypting ransomwares became popular during the 2010s and 2020s, having over millions of devices infected with ransomwares worldwide. The famous ransomware, which is called WannaCrypt0r, costs $300 to recover all files encrypted by the ransomware.
